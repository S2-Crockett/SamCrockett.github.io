### Job Description

Researching the role, I discovered what is required to be a Gameplay Programmer. A gameplay programmer 
must be able to communicate. At the start of every games development a gameplay programmer needs to 
work with writers and designers to determine how the game should play to produce the best possible 
result. Following on from this a Gameplay Programmer needs knowledge of gameplay and game engines, the
ability to determine the best mechanics and gameplay required for each given experience in a game and 
determining which engine to use to implement those mechanics to a high standard using different 
engines abilities.
